# geni-tools

geni-tools (formerly known as 'gcf') is a package containing various clients and sample servers of the [GENI Aggregate Manager API](http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/GeniApi). Notably, it includes the Stitcher and Omni commandline tools (used by the [GENI Portal](https://portal.geni.net) and [GENI Desktop](https://genidesktop.netlab.uky.edu) among others), and the GCF sample Aggregate Manager.

[GENI](http://www.geni.net) is a [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov) funded suite of software and hardware to support "at scale" research and to share resources for
experimentation, research and classroom use.

The [GENI Aggregate Manager API](http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/GeniApi) defines the interface for software that resource owners run to manage access to their resources.
