# GENI uses URNs to identify experimenters and resources
# The URN format is specified in the GENI AM document available at: http://www.geni.net/
# A URN is of form: urn:publicid:IDN+<domain>+<type>+<name>
# The base_name variable is where you specify the domain of your CH/AM/Users.
# Examples include plc//princeton, geni//gpo//gcf, and emulab.net

base_name=geni//gpo//gcf



# The directory that stores the trusted roots of your CH/AM 
# and those you have federated with
