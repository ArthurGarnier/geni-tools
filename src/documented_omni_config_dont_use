# Commented sample omni_config -- NOT USABLE
# This copy of omni_config is included for documentation.
# Lines beginnign with '#' should be removed for runtime

# This is a sample Omni config file
# This file is in JSON format
# It tells Omni how to talk to various Clearinghouses.
# And by extension, which Experimenter credentials to use.

# All certs below should be in pem format.
# All keys are private keys for signing things.

# This config has first omni general configs, and then
# per control framework configs.
# For each CF, you specify where the clearinghouse/SA XMLRPC
# interface can be reached, and the certificate and key to ID 
# yourself to that CH. Some CFs have other fields.
