# This is a sample Omni config file
# It tells Omni how to talk to various Clearinghouses.
# And by extension, which Experimenter credentials to use.

# Any given instance of omni makes calls to a framework 
# (e.g., SFA, ProtoGENI, etc..) to create slices, get slice
# credentials, and to find a list of authorized aggregates.
# This file specifies the control frameworks that you are
# a member of and the users that you want to be able to login
# to your allocated resources (e.g., virtual machines)


[omni]
# The default control framework for omni to use.
# Override on the commandline with -f argument.
# This should be the name of a section that you define below
# Note you could have multiple instances of the same type
# configured, EG for different MyPLC instances.
default_cf = my_sfa

# The slice_users argument in "CreateSliver".  It uploads
# names and public ssh keys to allocated resources for login.
# Details on users should be defined in sections below

# At least one framework section (sfa/pg/gcf) needs to be filled out
# and pointed to by default_cf
