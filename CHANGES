gcf 1.0 9/10:
        - RPM library install available, with dependencies
        - Refactored URN, certificate and credential utilities into library functions
	- Renamed gam -> gcf-am, gch, client
	- Refactored omni support files to parallel directory
        - gcf_config configures URNs, file locations, etc.
	- geni_aggregates incorporated into gcf_config
	- omni_config is now a Python properties file format
	- omni listresources takes optional AggregateManager URLs to contact
        - Drop CH.Resolve - not used

	- Dropped the CA certificate. The CH certificate is the self-signed root. Install only the CH
       certificate at all federated AMs to allow peering.
       - Dropped the -u user certificate argument to the GENI Clearinghouse - not needed.
       - Refactored common functionality for manipulating Credentials into new src/geni/credential.py
       - Shutdown now requires the shutdown privilege (which proper user credentials will have)
       - Omni supports OpenFlow Aggregate Managers and RSpecs (not yet the OpenFlow Clearinghouse)
       - More error checking of arguments and more helpful error messages 
       - omni_config now accepts # started comments
       - Comments and documentation
       - 

7/12/10:
	Much more documentation, error checking, logging, and clearer error
	reporting.

	Support credentials from multiple control frameworks / CAs
	without restarting.

	gcf-am and gcf-ch want the -r argument to be a directory of all
	trusted (federated) CA and Clearinghouse certificates, to be
	able to validate and accept certificates from multiple control
	frameworks at once.

	gcf-ch takes a user certificate argument for test purposes
