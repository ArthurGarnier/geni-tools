gcf 1.4:
        - Omni aborts if it detects your slice has expired
        - SFA logger handles log file conflicts (ticket #48)
        - SFA library bug fixes

gcf 1.3.1:
	- SFA library fixes with delegated slice credentials
	- Ensure the root error is reported to the user when there are
	problems.
	- Once the user has failed to enter their passphrase twice,
	exit - don't bury it in later errors. (ticket #43)
	- Clean up timezone handling (ticket #47)
        - examples directory contains simple scripting examples
        - New delegateSliceCred script allowing off-line delegation of
	slice credentials.
        Run src/delegateSliceCred.py -h for usage. (ticket #44)
	- More error message cleanup

gcf 1.3 May, 2011:
	GCF:
	- Fix certificates to be marked V3, instead of erroneously V1
	(ticket #36)
	- Support additional options in the AM's GetVersion
	- Bug fixes

	Omni:
	- Omnispecs are deprecated and native RSpecs are now the default.
	- New --omnispec option (default false). Users should use
	native RSpecs.
	- New -o and -p options controlling saving results in files
	(see getversion, sliverstatus, listResources, getslicecred,
	createsliver) (tickets #39,42)
	- --tostdout says when not saving results to files per -o
	option, write results to STDOUT instead of log stream (for redirecting)
	- New -t option to specify that Ad RSpecs must be of a
	particular type and version. An AM that cannot provide that
	format will not be included in results. (ticket #40)
	- Ticket #41: --slicecredfile specifies the name of a file to
	save/load a slice credential from.
	    createslice -o --slicecredfile <filename>
 	  saves the new slice credential there. AM calls can use the
	  credential. 
          For example: omni.py  --slicecredfile mysavedcred.xml \
	               createsliver myslicename myRSpec.xml
	- New listmyslices command added to see what your framework's
	registry has for you (ticket #38)
	- Refactoring to allow re-use of omni functions as library
	calls (ticket #37)
	- User feedback is clearer
	- Clean up error handling (tickets #25,28,29)
	- Check slice expiration, print for user (ticket #35)
	- New print_slice_expiration omni function
	- New api_test script to test AM API compliance and server availability
	- Add options for temporary Orca compatibility
	- Better config file searching
	- From Ezra Kissel: Enable allocating specific PG nodes from
	omnispecs (ticket #33)
	- Bug fixes

gcf 1.0 September, 2010:
        - RPM library install available, with dependencies
        - Refactored URN, certificate and credential utilities into
	library functions
	- Renamed gam -> gcf-am, gch, client
	- Refactored omni support files to parallel directory
        - gcf_config configures URNs, file locations, etc.
	- geni_aggregates incorporated into gcf_config
	- omni_config is now a Python properties file format
	- omni listresources takes optional AggregateManager URLs to contact
        - Drop CH.Resolve - not used

	- Dropped the CA certificate. The CH certificate is the
       self-signed root. Install only the CH certificate at all
       federated AMs to allow peering.
       - Dropped the -u user certificate argument to the GENI
       Clearinghouse - not needed.
       - Refactored common functionality for manipulating Credentials
       into new src/geni/credential.py
       - Shutdown now requires the shutdown privilege (which proper
       user credentials will have)
       - Omni supports OpenFlow Aggregate Managers and RSpecs (not yet
       the OpenFlow Clearinghouse)
       - More error checking of arguments and more helpful error messages 
       - omni_config now accepts # started comments
       - Comments and documentation
       - 

July, 2010:
	Much more documentation, error checking, logging, and clearer error
	reporting.

	Support credentials from multiple control frameworks / CAs
	without restarting.

	gcf-am and gcf-ch want the -r argument to be a directory of all
	trusted (federated) CA and Clearinghouse certificates, to be
	able to validate and accept certificates from multiple control
	frameworks at once.

	gcf-ch takes a user certificate argument for test purposes
